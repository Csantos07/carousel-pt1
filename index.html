              For Emma, Forever Ago is the debut studio album by American indie
              folk band Bon Iver. It was first self-released in July 2007, and
              later saw wide release on the Jagjaguwar label in February 2008.
              The album is principally the work of singer-songwriter Justin
              Vernon. Whilst living in Raleigh, North Carolina, Vernon fell ill
              with mononucleosis and a ...
              <!-- liver infection, and grew frustrated with his songwriting and life. He
          left Raleigh and drove an hour northwest of his hometown, Eau Claire,
          Wisconsin, to a remote cabin in the woods belonging to his father,
          where he spent three months writing and recording the bulk of the
          album. The album's lyrical subjects include lost love and mediocrity.
          Despite receiving mostly positive reviews, the album was not an
          immediate success, failing to enter the Billboard 200 until a year
          after its release. It reached number 29 on the UK Albums Chart, and
          was met with critical acclaim. The album was later remastered and
          rereleased in 2016 as a part of a series of reissues of Jagjaguwar's
          back catalog. -->
